## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A subdued, professional blue (#5DADE2) to convey trust and competence. Its hue evokes knowledge, skill, and experience.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), very slightly blue in hue (20% saturation of the primary color). This gives a clean, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#A569BD), approximately 30 degrees 'left' of the primary on the color wheel. It provides contrast without being too loud, and reinforces feelings of professionalism and preparation.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and neutral aesthetic
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different resume sections and actions.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with ample white space to enhance readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
